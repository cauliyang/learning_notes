\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Don’t spend too much time reading other people’s research, waiting for inspiration to strike you.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item  Reading research should be a regular part of any economist’s routine.
		      \item But it is not a substitute for doing your own.
	      \end{enumerate}

	\item Don’t set the bar too high. You don’t need to win the Nobel.
	\item  But don’t set the bar too low!
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Be wary of picking a topic that is of interest to a small number of people (e.g. you and your adviser).
		      \item In particular, think about topics that will interest those beyond this island
	      \end{enumerate}
	\item Your ideas and results won’t sell themselves.
	\item How you communicate your work is of crucial importance.
	\item There is no point in having an interesting piece of research that nobody understands or sees the point of.
	\item Many economists think of themselves as primarily experts in technical methods: Econometrics, economic theory, data expertise.
	\item This “white coat” mentality—that we are mainly scientists who then do a write-up of our results—is deeply wrong.
	\item Writing is an essential part of the research process, not a last-minute thing to be rushed.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Latex Writing Tips}

\begin{itemize}
	\item use \verb|\usepackage{microtype}| to improve the appearance of the text.
	\item use \verb|\tablename~\ref{tab}| to reference table.
	\item use \verb|\figurename~\ref{fig}| to reference figure.
	\item \verb|Eq.~\eqref{eq1}|
	\item comments from different people can be distinguished by different colors. \verb|\newcommand{\yl}[1]{{\color{blue}{[(YL): #1]}}}|

\section{PhD Theses TIPs}


The PhD Thesis Tips from \url{https://www.karlwhelan.com/Teaching/PhD/phd-writing-talk.pdf}.

What makes a good thesis? Forget about objectivity—beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
A good thesis is one that readers think is good.
So, you need to explain well what you are doing to somebody else.
Your ideas and results won’t sell themselves.
How you communicate your work is of crucial importance.
There is no point in having an interesting piece of research that nobody understands or sees the point of.
The “white coat” mentality—that we are mainly scientists who then do a write-up of our results—is misguided.
Writing is an essential part of the research process, not a last-minute thing to be rushed.
This is particularly true of PhD theses which are read very carefully by externs, who are hoping that you have explained what you have done in a clear fashion.

\paragraph{Writing Skills: More Important Than You Think}

There is no point in having an interesting piece of research that nobody understands or sees the point of.
The  ``white coat" mentality—that we are mainly scientists who then do a write-up of our results—is misguided.
Writing is an essential part of the research process, not a last-minute thing to be rushed.
This is particularly true of PhD theses which are read very carefully by externs, who are hoping that you have explained what you have done in a clear fashion.

\paragraph{Start by Avoiding Very Bad Writing}
People can be quite sensitive about their writing.
If you are a native English speaker and you have a degree, you probably think you know how to write and communicate well.
Chances are, you might be wrong.
Most MA graduates and even many professional PhD-qualified economists write very poorly.
Good writing is hard to define. Bad writing is easy to spot.
A badly-written thesis will have:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Mis-spelled words.
	\item Missing words.
	\item Sentences that don’t make sense or aren’t proper sentences.
	\item Poor use of punctuation – full stops, commas etc.
\end{enumerate}
This annoys the reader because it makes things harder to read (and understand) but also because it’s so easy to prevent.
It suggests you didn’t take the time to be careful.

\paragraph{What To Do About It?}
Read, re-read, edit, and re-edit.
And do this as you go along.
Read and edit after you’ve written a page or so.
This can correct most of the common errors of style, grammar, and spelling that occur in the writing process.
Most of you actually do know what a sentence is.
In addition to catching typos, a quick re-read and edit allows you to check that what you’ve written gets across what you’ve been trying to say.
Sometimes you can think you’ve made a point clearly but then you read what you’ve written and it’s not so good.
Read your stuff aloud or slowly to yourself.
Does it sound right? Are you writing proper sentences? Are you over-using jargon or certain particular phrases?
Use spell checks but don’t rely on them.
Grammar. There are rules about how to use commas, colons, semi-colons, full stops, about what defines a sentence. Try to learn them.

\section{Abstract}


\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introductions are crucial because they set up the reader to understand what your topic is and what you are going to do in your paper.
	\item Quickly explain two things:
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Why is the topic of your paper interesting?
		      \item What did YOU do? What is YOUR contribution? A new question? An existing question but new methodology? Existing question, existing methodology, new data (e.g. no previous Irish application)?
	      \end{enumerate}

	\item Be willing to give an outline of what your results are but don’t get into too many details.
	\item Because of its importance, spend a lot of time on the introduction.
	\item But don’t make it too long. Three pages is a limit. Two is better.
	\item I often start writing the introduction as soon I have some results and then keep adjusting it as the paper evolves.
	\item Conclusions, on the other hand, should be kept short and to the point. Don’t repeat lots of stuff from the intro.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Literature Reviews}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item You need to explain your contribution.
	\item So it needs to be put in context.
	\item This will require discussion of previous studies in this area.
	\item Remember, though, the purpose is to set up your contribution, and distinguish it from previous work.
	\item Don’t simply provide a long list of separate descriptions of weakly related studies. (X (2007) did this. Y(2009) did that ...)
	\item Grouping studies together by type may be a better way of explaining it than listing lots of separate individual studies.
	\item A well-focused literature review is usually a useful component of a PhD thesis. It shows externs and your supervisor that you have read the literature.
	\item However, it is not essential that articles submitted for publication have a literature review. You may be able to summarise the existing literature in your introduction or work it into your opening section that sets up what you are doing.
